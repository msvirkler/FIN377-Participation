# FIN377-Participation

Welcome to my repo for Fin 377 data ananlytics with Professor Bowen. There are three folders titles homework, live coding and codebook. 

The livecoding folder contains the code that we wrote and followed in class. The codebook folder contains cheat sheets and shortcuts. The Homework folder simply contains our after class assigments.
